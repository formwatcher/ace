# Ace decorator for [formwatcher](http://www.formwatcher.org)

Turns textarea fields into the awesome [ace editor](http://ace.ajax.org).


The actual ace editor is **not** included in this decorator.

Include the [ace src-noconflict](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace-builds/tree/master/src-noconflict)
files (at least the `ace.js` file) yourself before including this decorator.
